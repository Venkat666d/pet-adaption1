        <h1>6 Essential Tips On Caring For Your Senior Dog</h1>
        <p>Age catches up to our geriatric canine companions as it does to everyone. It’s the circle of life that repeats itself in every living being and it’s our duty to make this transition as smooth as possible for our furry friends. Canine care in these sunset years is crucial; we need to care for our older companions as we take care of ageing family members - all it takes is love and sensitivity.</p>
        <h2>Keep them active</h2>
        <p>Old dogs struggle to display the energy and effervescence of their younger selves. Instead, in their later years, they struggle with a slowing metabolism, loss of appetite and other illnesses that ail their daily movement. That said, it’s important to keep them moving and active for a good portion of time every day.</p>
        <h2>Maintain a nutritious diet</h2>
        <p>As dogs grow older, they tend to shed a fair bit of muscle mass, along with joint and muscle pain that only get amplified with age. To solve these problems, your dog care routine must include a complete and balanced diet.</p>
        <h2>Visit the vet</h2>
        <p>Although this suggestion may not exactly seem like music to your pet’s ears, we are not equipped to catch early signs of illnesses and afflictions that the vet can. This is especially important as their immunity drops.</p>
        <h2>Make changes to your home</h2>
        <p>Certain surfaces in the home need to be altered to care for your ageing pet whose eyesight is deteriorating. This is a critical part of senior dog care.</p>
        <h2>Keep them out of trouble</h2>
        <p>Make sure that your senior dog stays out of fights with other canines in the home and those outside as far as possible.</p>
        <h2>Be there for your dog</h2>
        <p>Old age is a hard thing for most of us to fathom, but it can be especially hard-hitting for our canine friends. Spend time around them, even if you’re not doing much. Your dog will cherish this more than you can imagine.</p>
